# Example_AsyncTasks_in_Android_Studio
In this repository, we will learn to write programs that run processes outside the main thread, which is known as the UI thread. This technique will allow our applications to process time-consuming without crashing the graphical interface, keeping them functional and pleasant for the user. For this, we will use Threads, Handlers and AsyncTasks.
